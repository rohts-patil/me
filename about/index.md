## About me
Software Developer by day, Self-Driving Car Engineer by night. My interests are Computer Vision, Deep Learning and NLP. I work at ION Commodities(Triple Point Technology, Pune).

In my spare time, I love doing several things which in my opinion could improve my skills. For instance, I love reading any book but I always have a place for mathematics and algorithm books. Reading those kinds of book helps me a lot in enhancing abstraction skill and creativity. In addition, I also love learning new technologies from the internet. Mostly, I learn by reading research papers related to my interests. I found this activity useful since I could get insights on the methodology which had never been thought of before. Hereafter, I applied the methodology to implement the paper.

Besides science and technology, I also have personal interest on history, education, environment, health, and human rights.
