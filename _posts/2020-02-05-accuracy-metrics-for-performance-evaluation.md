### When is your prediction function good?

1. Compare to previous  models, if they exist.
2. Is it good enough for business purposes?
3. But also helpful to have simple baseline models for comparison.
	1. To make sure you are doing significantly better than trivial models.
	2. To make sure the problem you are working on even has a useful target function.
